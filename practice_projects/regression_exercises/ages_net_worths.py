### get Katie's net worth (she's 27)
### sklearn predictions are returned in an array, so you'll want to index into
### the output to get what you want, e.g. net_worth = predict([[27]])[0][0] (not
### exact syntax, the point is the [0] at the end). In addition, make sure the
### argument to your prediction function is in the expected format - if you get
### a warning about needing a 2d array for your data, a list of lists will be
### interpreted by sklearn as such (e.g. [[27]]).
km_net_worth = reg.predict([[27]])[0][0] ### fill in the line of code to get the right value

### get the slope
### again, you'll get a 2-D array, so stick the [0][0] at the end
slope = reg.coef_[0][0] ### fill in the line of code to get the right value

### get the intercept
### here you get a 1-D array, so stick [0] on the end to access
### the info we want
intercept = reg.intercept_[0] ### fill in the line of code to get the right value


### get the score on test data
test_score = reg.score(ages_test, net_worths_test) ### fill in the line of code to get the right value


### get the score on the training data
training_score = reg.score(ages_train, net_worths_train)  ### fill in the line of code to get the right value

print ({"networth":km_net_worth,
        "slope":slope,
